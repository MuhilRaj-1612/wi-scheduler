How to use ? 

This application enables you to make a scheduled messages on whasapp and instagram.
How this application works:
* It will ask you to choose whatsapp / instagram. You should choose one
* It will ask your schedule timing to send the message
* In case of whatsapp automation it will ask you the user number to send the message.
* In case of instagram automation it will ask you the username to send the message
* It will ask you to type the message you wanna send to the user

The timing will start. In this program there will be three different timings.

1. 2 Minutes advanced timer 
2. Correct timer
3. Your schedule timer

Your browser will open before two minutes from the time you set. And all processes will be
done. And the message will reach the target in the perfect scheduled timing
